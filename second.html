					<p>
						In the Netherlands, most pipes and cables for gas, water, sewage, telephone, internet and electricity are buried beneath the street. Electricity is produced from various sources, including coal-fired power stations and wind farms, i.e. green power (groene stroom). Gas for household use is piped into almost all homes in the Netherlands. Drinking water in Amsterdam and the region is provided by Waternet.
					</p>
					<h2>Water</h2>
					<p>
						Most accommodation is already connected to the water supply of drinking water provider Waternet, and can be used immediately. A water meter in the home measures consumption. You will be sent a form each year requesting the current meter reading.
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition to the cost of water itself, Waternet will also send a tax bill to everyone registered in the municipal register (bevolkingsregister). This bill includes a waste water purification tax (zuiveringsheffing) and a maintenance fee for the dykes and the water level.
					</p>
					<p>Waternet also maintains the sewers and monitors dykes and the water level in the Netherlands. Municipality tax (gemeentebelasting) also contributes to the cost of this.</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Registering with Waternet</strong> Not yet a Waternet client? Contact them on telephone number <strong>0900 93 94</strong> (local rate). Do not forget to note the water meter reading not only when moving into a new home, but also (if necessary) when moving out. It is possible to manage your account and notify Waternet of the meter reading online at Mijn Waternet. The website is in Dutch, but Waternet provides an English-language guide to using it.
					</p>
					<p>
						Problems with drinking water or sewage system For problems with the sewers, telephone <strong>0900 93 94</strong> (local rate).
					</p>
					<p>Please note: interior pipes are not the responsibility of Waternet. For blocked or leaking pipes in the home, contact a plumber (loodgieter). No running water may be the result of excavations in the street or freezing temperatures. In case of problems, telephone <strong>0900 93 94</strong> (local rate) day or night.</p>
					<h2>Gas and electricity</h2>
					<p>Gas and electricity are both supplied by the same provider. The Dutch energy market was privatised years ago, and there are now many providers. It is important to quickly arrange gas and electricity in a new home.</p>
					<p>
						Power is usually kept on for the first few days, but it will be switched off as soon as the previous occupants close their account. When moving into a new home, note the meter reading and notify the energy supplier. Customers can choose their own supplier, but the choice may be limited by those operating in the community.</p>
						<h2>Green energy</h2>
						<p>Many suppliers offer green energy (groene stroom). Also termed sustainable energy, green energy is electricity produced from environmentally friendly sources such as the wind, sun, organic matter or water power. Green energy is available from some suppliers at no extra cost; others charge a higher rate.</p>
