Synopsis

First steps taken into using SASS. If you write copious amounts of CSS, a pre-processor can greatly decrease your stress levels and save you a lot of precious time. This repo is thus my first attemtp to use SASS.

Motivation
I made a list of the things I need from style sheets:
variables [Sass]
data structures [Sass]
loops (of data structures) [Sass]
nesting [Sass]
color conversions (specifically HSB) [Sass]

SASS let;s ou do all of those things.
